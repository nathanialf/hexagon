Design Doc: HexCell(needs name)

Gameplay:
- No fucking clue yet


Art:
- Particle loop background similar to braid with space atmosphere
	- No clue how to do it
- Random map generation. Doesn't go forever. At max with current algorithm is 1000


Hexagon Map Generation:
- Start with Base Hexagon
	- Player Starts there
- Keep a value to see if you need to restart the generation from a new cell
	- if needs restarted, find the first instance of a cell with a free adjacent cell
	- stop the search there.
	- if it doesn't need restarted it gets the last generated cell
	- selected cell is the new base for generation
-random generates how many cells you want to generate adjacent to base
-count how many free adjacent cells are to the base cell
	- if the random number is more than possible for the base cell, the random number becomes the adjacent number
	- if there is no adjacent cells stop current pass-through and restart with it needing restarted
- repeats for the adjacent number or random number
	- randomly generates position of next cell
	- if its empty create cell
	- if not, failed loop passthrough, still counts to counter for loop but not cell count
	- check adjacent and if it can be drawn(performance purposes)
- repeat whole generation passthrough without need for reset
