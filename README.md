This is a hexagon map generator thing that may turn into a game. Right now it sits there and looks pretty.

Screen shots of it are in the res/ScreenShots directory.

To do:
<ul>
  <li>Make checkboxes work
  <li>Make Statistics Menu work
  <li>Generate a smaller hexagon map on load to display in the map menu
  <li>Fix squished hexagon bug
</ul>
